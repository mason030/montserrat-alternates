<b>Montserrat Alternates is clean, exciting, and a brand new take on modern
  urban fonts with smooth arcs to boot!</b>
<p>The Montserrat Alternates typeface was part of a stretch goal when Julieta
  Ulanovsky was kickstarting her original Montserrat typeface. It was inspired
  by the signage and posters she saw in her home neighboorhood in Buenos Aires,
  Argentina. Originally based off of other sans-serif fonts like Trebuchet, it
  started off in 2003 and was ultimately released nearly a decade later in 2001.
  With an urban, modern aesthetic and a geometric structure, she created a unique
  and flexible font that can pop in most any situation!</p>
<p>In addition to working on the Montserrat Typeface, Julieta Ulanovsky has
   also written multiple books consisting of exotic patterns found in various
   landmarks across Buenos Aires. As a graphic desinger, she's worked a lot
   with photography. She's recently worked on a new typeface by the name of
   'Confiteria' another geometric script font with more of a display purpose.</p>

  <h3>About us</h3>

  <p>We serve more than 900,000 vehicles on an average day. In 2019, we carried
    more traffic than any bridge and tunnel authority in the nation—more than
    329 million vehicles. Surplus revenues from our tolls help support MTA
    public transit services.</p>

  <p>All of our crossings use cashless, electronic tolling systems. This lets
    us process traffic more quickly and safely and reduces carbon emissions and
    fuel consumption.</p>

  <p class = "dateNote">Updated Mar 10, 2020</p>

  <p>Before the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge opened on April 29, 1939, the Robert F.
    Kennedy Bridge (formerly Triborough), five miles to the west, provided the
    only vehicular connection between Queens and the Bronx. The Bronx Whitestone
    opened to traffic a mere 23 months after the awarding of its first
    construction contract so that motorists could cross it on April 30, the
    opening day of the 1939 New York World's Fair in Flushing Meadow Park.</p>

  <p>Today, the bridge looks as modern and elegant as when it served as the
    gateway to the fair's "World of Tomorrow." As part of the massive bridge
    project two major recreational areas were developed, Ferry Point Park in the
    Bronx and Francis Lewis Park in Queens.</p>

  <p>The bridge spans the East River. On the Bronx side are the residential
    communities of Unionport and Schuylerville and connections to the Hutchinson
    River Parkway, the Bruckner Expressway, and the Cross Bronx Expressway. On
    the Queens side are the residential communities of Whitestone and Malba and
    connections to the Cross Island Parkway and the Whitestone Expressway.</p>
